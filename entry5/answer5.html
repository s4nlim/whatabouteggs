    <p class="text"> Erm... Actually...<br>
        When the chicken was evolving<br>
        from  its predecessors, each mutation<br>
        became  physically independent in the form<br>
        of an egg.  The egg hatched, you got more and more<br>
        of a chicken each time. Gradually, the domestic chicken<br>
        evolved into what it is. So even though the egg didn't just<br>
        pop out of nowhere and spawn the first ever completely<br>
        unique chicken, through gradual evolution the egg<br>
        introduced the chicken little by little as animals<br>
        do not mutate into other animals through<br> 
        their lifetime but rather<br>
        at birth. </p>

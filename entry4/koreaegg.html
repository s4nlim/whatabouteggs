        <p>Gyeranjjim (Korean: 계란찜), also known as dalgyal-jjim (달걀찜), is a soft and fluffy Korean steamed egg dish. It’s a type of jjim, meaning “steamed,” and is often enjoyed as a warm banchan (side dish) served alongside rice and soup. Its texture is light and custardy, similar to a savory egg pudding, and it’s known for its comforting, mild flavor.</p>
        <p>The dish is made by whisking eggs with water or broth until smooth and creamy. For a richer taste, some use kelp or anchovy broth instead of plain water. Common seasonings include saeu-jeot (salted shrimp), myeongnan-jeot (salted pollock roe), or simple salt. It’s then gently cooked by steaming, double boiling, or slowly heating in a hot stone pot until the eggs puff up into a soft dome.</p>
        <p>Before serving, gyeranjjim is topped with chopped scallions, sesame seeds, or thin slices of chili for color and flavor. Some variations add vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini, or carrots for extra texture. The ideal gyeranjjim is airy, slightly jiggly, and full of savory aroma—a simple yet deeply satisfying Korean comfort food.</p>
